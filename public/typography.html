        <b>A Photograph</b> 
        <i>Shirley Toulson</i> 
        <br>
        The cardboard shows me how it was
        When the two girl cousins went paddling
        Each one holding one of my mother’s hands,
        And she the big girl - some twelve years or so.
        All three stood still to smile through their hair
        At the uncle with the camera, A sweet face
        My mother’s, that was before I was born
        And the sea, which appears to have changed less
        Washed their terribly transient feet.
        Some twenty- thirty- years later
        She’d laugh at the snapshot. “See Betty
        And Dolly," she’d say, “and look how they
        Dressed us for the beach." The sea holiday
        was her past, mine is her laughter. Both wry
        With the laboured ease of loss
        Now she’s has been dead nearly as many years
        As that girl lived. And of this circumstance
        There is nothing to say at all,
        Its silence silences.
